I am accepting the proposal. Pl go through my below comments and adapt your project accordingly. (Feel free to meet me for a discussion if required.)

Your abstract does not convey much specifics. I accept that the project should go with the overarching theme as per the project guidelines. 

For projects like these you can expect three pipelines: P1, P2 and P3.

P1 involves options for ingesting your data — your interface should should support necessary options for specifying the source. Then from a list of pre-processing operations you should be able to design a multi-level pipeline. And, options for executing them. On finishing, the data should be loaded on to HDFS/MongoDB (data store) — of course Hive/Pig scripts can be used internally for pre-processing.

P2 involves pipelines for retrieving appropriate documents from your data store  based on keyword search. 

P3 involves data processing and analytical tasks, fetching data from the data store. And, proper embedding of the visualisation tool on your interface is also important here. 

As per my understanding your proposal touches all the three pipelines. However, I would suggest you to focus on either P1 and P2, or P2 and P3, due to time limitations and since there are specific challenges associated with each stage — for instance P3 needs integration of data visualisation with your front-end.
